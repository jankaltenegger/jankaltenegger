I've been learning to code since I was 12, in order to follow in my dad's footsteps. I started out with Lua, trying to code up scripts for my video game problems. This has brought me to my current favored language, Python, due to its' simplicity and versatility. I am currently on the lookout for a Software Engineer Internship in backend development, ideally writing Python or Java. I'd love to work in businesses of any size, as long as there is enough new information for me to soak up. If you're hiring, connect with me on LinkedIn and let's chat!
