# Hi there, my name's Jan Kaltenegger 👋

### 🎓 Undergraduate Researcher & IT Student
**Based in:** Lawrenceville/Duluth, GA 🇺🇸 | **Origin:** Austria 🇦🇹

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I started learning to code when I was in Middle School, originally trying to script solutions for my video game problems using **Lua**. That curiosity set me on a path to follow in my father's footsteps and ultimately led me to the United States to pursue my degree.

I have a passion for anything to do with **System-Level Programming, Hardware, and Algorithms**. My current favorite languages are **C and C++**, specifically applied to:
* **High-Level Synthesis (HLS)** & **FPGAs** (Zynq SoCs)
* **Computer Architecture**
* **NixOS** & Reproducible Builds

### 🔭 Current Research & Projects
I am currently conducting research at the intersection of **High-Performance Computing**, **Robotics**, and **Topological Data Analysis**.

* **🤖 PackBot Modernization (ROS2):** Leading the hardware retrofitting of iRobot PackBots, decoupling proprietary electronics to build an open-source ROS 2 research platform.
* **⚡ Latency-Critical Finance on FPGA:** Developing a hardware-software co-design framework on Zynq SoCs using **Nix** to ensure deterministic build environments for HFT signal processing.
* **🧠 TDA + Machine Learning:** Engineered a bio-computational pipeline using **Vietoris-Rips filtration** to analyze fMRI data for ASD classification.
* **📈 Algorithmic Trading:** Built a quantitative back-testing framework in Python, analyzing 18 years of S&P 500 data to optimize risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe/Sortino ratios).
